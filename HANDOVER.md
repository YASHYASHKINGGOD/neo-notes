# Neo Notes - Comprehensive Handover Document

## Project Overview
A neo-brutalist note-taking application built with React 19 + TypeScript + Vite, featuring:
- Bold borders and high contrast design
- Hierarchical folder organization
- Theme customization system
- Local storage persistence
- Knowledge graph visualization (planned)
- Wiki-style note linking

## Current Status: v1.0 Complete, Ready for v2.0

### ‚úÖ What's Working
1. **Full Interface Restored**: Sidebar, note editor, and theme customizer
2. **Theme System**: Complete theme customization with CSS variables
3. **Note Management**: Create, edit, delete notes with proper persistence
4. **Folder System**: Hierarchical folder organization with nesting
5. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Cmd/Ctrl+N for new note, Cmd/Ctrl+, for theme customizer
6. **Browser Compatibility**: Fixed blank screen issues across Chrome/Safari
7. **Local Storage**: Automatic saving of notes, folders, themes, and selections

### üîß Recently Fixed Issues
1. **Theme Persistence**: Themes now save automatically to localStorage
2. **Folder Nesting**: Notes created in folders are properly nested and visible
3. **Blank Screen Bug**: Resolved browser compatibility issues that caused blank screens
4. **Port Conflicts**: Changed from port 5175 to 8080 for stability
5. **Initialization Race Conditions**: Fixed localStorage loading timing issues

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite
- **State Management**: Zustand with localStorage persistence
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS with CSS variables for theming
- **Build Tool**: Vite with HMR for development

## State Management (store.ts)

### Data Models
```typescript
interface Note {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  folderId: string | null;
  tags: string[];
  links: string[];      // For v2.0 wiki-style linking
  backlinks: string[];  // For v2.0 reverse links
  attachments: string[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface Folder {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  parentId: string | null;
  color?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### Key Store Functions
- **Note Operations**: `addNote()`, `updateNote()`, `deleteNote()`, `selectNote()`
- **Folder Operations**: `addFolder()`, `updateFolder()`, `deleteFolder()`, `selectFolder()`
- **Theme Management**: `setTheme()`, `applyThemeToCSS()`, `toggleThemeCustomizer()`
- **Persistence**: `initFromLocalStorage()`, `saveToLocalStorage()`
- **Graph Operations**: `getGraphNodes()`, `getGraphConnections()` (for v2.0)

## Current Configuration

### Server Configuration (vite.config.ts)
```typescript
server: {
  host: '0.0.0.0',
  port: 8080,           // Changed from 5175 to fix conflicts
  strictPort: true,
  open: true,
}
```

### App Initialization (App.tsx)
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('üöÄ Neo Notes Full Version Loading...');
  
  // Initialize from localStorage first
  initFromLocalStorage();
  
  // Apply initial theme immediately
  applyThemeToCSS(currentTheme);
  
  // Mark as ready after loading
  setTimeout(() => {
    setIsReady(true);
    console.log('‚úÖ Full interface ready');
  }, 100);
}, []);
```

## Recent Problem-Solving Journey

### Issue 1: Theme Persistence Not Working
**Problem**: Theme changes weren't being saved between sessions
**Solution**: Added localStorage persistence to `setTheme()` function:
```typescript
setTheme: (theme) => {
  set({ currentTheme: theme });
  get().applyThemeToCSS(theme);
  
  // Save to localStorage for web version
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    localStorage.setItem('rob-yyn-notes-theme', JSON.stringify(theme));
  }
}
```

### Issue 2: Folder Nesting Problems
**Problem**: Notes created in folders weren't properly nested
**Solution**: Fixed `addNote()` logic:
```typescript
addNote: (folderId = null) => {
  const newNote: Note = {
    // ... other properties
    folderId: folderId !== undefined ? folderId : get().selectedFolderId,
  };
}
```

### Issue 3: Critical Blank Screen Bug
**Problem**: App showed blank screen in all browsers after localStorage changes
**Root Cause**: Complex initialization timing and port conflicts
**Solutions Applied**:
1. Changed port from 5175 to 8080
2. Simplified App.tsx initialization sequence
3. Added proper loading states
4. Created test versions to isolate React compilation issues
5. Progressive restoration approach

**Debugging Process**:
- Researched React+Vite blank screen issues via web search
- Found common causes: port conflicts, browser extensions, initialization timing
- Created simplified test-app.html to verify server functionality
- Gradually restored full functionality piece by piece

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm run dev

# Build for production
pnpm run build

# Preview production build
pnpm run preview
```

## Current Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues
1. **HMR Warnings**: Some hot module replacement warnings in development (non-blocking)
2. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Some loose typing that could be tightened
3. **Error Boundaries**: No error boundaries for graceful failure handling

### Performance Considerations
1. **Large Note Sets**: No virtualization for large numbers of notes
2. **Search Performance**: Linear search through all notes
3. **Storage Limits**: localStorage has size limitations for very large datasets

## Development Environment

### Browser Compatibility
- ‚úÖ Chrome: Working (after blank screen fix)
- ‚úÖ Safari: Working
- ‚úÖ Firefox: Likely working (not explicitly tested)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Mobile: Not optimized for mobile yet

### System Requirements
- Node.js 18+
- pnpm package manager
- Modern browser with ES2020 support

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Blank Screen Issues
If you encounter a blank screen:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify port 8080 is available
3. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
4. Restart development server
5. Try the test-app.html for basic functionality verification

### Port Conflicts
If port 8080 is in use:
1. Change port in `vite.config.ts`
2. Update any hardcoded references
3. Restart the development server

### localStorage Issues
If persistence isn't working:
1. Check browser console for localStorage errors
2. Verify browser allows localStorage
3. Clear existing data and restart
4. Check for storage quota limits

## Next Steps for v2.0 Development

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Wiki-Style Linking**: Implement `[[Note Title]]` syntax
2. **Backlink Generation**: Automatic reverse link creation
3. **Graph Visualization**: Interactive knowledge graph component
4. **Enhanced Search**: Full-text search with filters

### Technical Improvements
1. **Error Boundaries**: Add React error boundaries
2. **Performance**: Implement virtualization for large datasets
3. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests
4. **Mobile Responsive**: Optimize for mobile devices

### Feature Enhancements
1. **Markdown Support**: Rich text editing capabilities
2. **File Attachments**: Drag & drop file support
3. **Export/Import**: JSON/Markdown export capabilities
4. **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility

## Final Notes

The application is currently in a stable state with all core v1.0 features working correctly. The theme persistence and folder nesting issues have been resolved, and the blank screen bug has been fixed through careful debugging and progressive restoration.

The codebase is ready for v2.0 development, with a solid foundation in place for adding wiki-style linking and knowledge graph features. The localStorage persistence system is robust and handles all data correctly.

All recent changes have been tested and verified working in both Chrome and Safari browsers. The development server runs reliably on port 8080 with hot module replacement for efficient development workflow.
