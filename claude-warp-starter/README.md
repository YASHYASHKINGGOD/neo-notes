# Claude & Warp Starter Workspace

A ready-to-run skeleton so **Claude Code** and **Warp.dev** can implement and test independently â€” and **you** can clone, run, and verify without chat history.

## Quickstart
```bash
# clone or unzip this project, then:
make setup
cp .env.example .env   # fill in placeholders if needed
make start             # or: make dev
make test              # run tests
```
See `OPERATING_MANUAL.md` for the full playbook.
